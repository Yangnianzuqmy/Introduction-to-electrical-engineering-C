In this course, we will learn about crawling data from the Internet, image processing and realizing a lightweight search engine.

I will provide requirements of each experiment in requirement folder.

And my answers and reports will be provided in my_answer folder.

In our project, we need to use what we've learned in this course to design a search engine. We designed a Music search engine. We can input a textual query and then the engine will return relative information.
Many aspects of information are included, such as singer image, singer information, album image, album information and so on. And it can play music and show the corresponding lyric at the same time.
Besides, our search engine can also return information according to sounds. It can find songs whose melody are similiar to the sounds.  

The source codes of our final project can be found in final_project folder.

Part of functions of the final project are realized on linux, the remaining on windows. So we divide the final project into 2 parts, as can be seen in final_project folder.
